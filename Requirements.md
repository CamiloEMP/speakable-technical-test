### **Canvas LMS and Firebase Integration with Student Accounts**

**Objective:** Build a Node.js hypothetical application to integrate with the Canvas LMS API for authenticating users, retrieving classroom sections, extracting student accounts from these sections, and creating corresponding records for both sections and student accounts in a Firebase application. Create all the files and functions necessary. Since you wonâ€™t have access to valid API keys, we cannot test the application. However, assume that this would be a live application.

**Duration:** 7 days from the challenge start date.

**Deliverables:**

1. A Node.js application that integrates with the Canvas LMS API and Firebase to fulfill the specified requirements.
2. Comprehensive documentation that includes:
   - Instructions for setting up and running the application.
   - Detailed summaries of Node.js functions for authentication, data retrieval from Canvas, and data creation in Firebase.
   - A section outlining any assumptions made and the rationale behind significant decisions.

**Requirements:**

1. **Authentication:**
   - Implement an authentication mechanism with the Canvas LMS API.
   - Use the obtained authentication token for subsequent API requests.
2. **Retrieve Classroom Sections and Student Accounts:**
   - Develop functionality to fetch classroom sections for a specified course from Canvas LMS.
   - For each section retrieved, extract the list of enrolled students, including necessary details such as student IDs, names, and email addresses.
3. **Firebase Integration for Sections and Students:**
   - Set up a Firebase application as the backend to store classroom section and student account data.
   - Create Firebase records for each classroom section and individual student accounts extracted from the Canvas LMS, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
4. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Implement robust error handling for API integration, gracefully managing failed requests and unexpected responses.
   - Include error logging for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.
5. **Documentation:**
   - Provide detailed documentation for the application setup and operation.
   - Document each Node.js function, detailing its purpose, inputs, outputs, and interactions with Canvas API and Firebase.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- **Completeness:** All specified functionalities are correctly implemented.
- **Code Quality:** The application's code is clean, efficiently organized, and adheres to Node.js best practices.
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling strategies are in place, with appropriate logging for errors.
- **Documentation:** The provided documentation is clear, detailed, facilitating easy application setup, and understanding of the codebase.
- **Innovation:** Extra points for creativity and adding features that enhance the application's functionality or user experience.
